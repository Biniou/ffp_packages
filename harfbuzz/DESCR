HarfBuzz is an OpenType text shaping engine. There are two HarfBuzz code 
trees in existence today: 

The current HarfBuzz tree, also known as harfbuzz-ng, is under active 
development and is what is used in Firefox 4. It is available here. 

The old HarfBuzz tree, derived from FreeType, Pango, and Qt, is 
available here. It is not actively developed or maintained. All users 
are encouraged to switch over to the new HarfBuzz.
