MMSRIP is a client for the proprietary protocol MMS://.
It actually saves to a file the content being streamed.
Please remember that this is not intended for real use, its existence 
is only and must only be documentary.

It should run on every POSIX compliant Operating System, but 
I can't give you any complete list.

This program is highly based on the work of SDP Multimedia and Major MMS.
They deserve all the credits for it.
