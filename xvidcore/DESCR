What is Xvid?

Xvid is a video codec for PC, whereas codec is an abbreviation for 
[co]der/[dec]oder, hence describes a program to encode and decode digital video.

The purpose of encoding video data is to reduce redundancies â€“ that means to 
make it smaller for faster transmission over computer networks or for more 
efficient storage on computer disks.
