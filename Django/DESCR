Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid 
development and clean, pragmatic design.

Developed by a fast-moving online-news operation, Django was designed 
to handle two challenges: 
the intensive deadlines of a newsroom and the stringent requirements 
of the experienced Web developers who wrote it. 
It lets you build high-performing, elegant Web applications quickly.

Django focuses on automating as much as possible and adhering 
to the DRY principle.
