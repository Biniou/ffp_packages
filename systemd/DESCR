systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with SysV 
and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization 
capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, 
offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using 
Linux control groups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system 
state, maintains mount and automount points and implements an elaborate 
transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can work as a 
drop-in replacement for sysvinit.
