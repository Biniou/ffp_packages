Parchive parity files (or par files for short) create redundant data 
that can be used later in case parts of the original data is 
lost or corrupted. 

Par files allow file level recovery of data. 

That is, out of a group of many files, if a limited number of files 
are lost or corrupted, they can be recovered. 

These files will have the extensions of .par, .p01, .p02 etc.
