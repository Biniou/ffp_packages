 Guile is the GNU Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions, the 
official extension language for the GNU operating system. 

Guile is a library designed to help programmers create flexible 
applications. Using Guile in an application allows the application's 
functionality to be extended by users or other programmers with 
plug-ins, modules, or scripts. Guile provides what might be described as 
"practical software freedom," making it possible for users to customize 
an application to meet their needs without digging into the 
application's internals. 

There is a long list of proven applications that employ extension 
languages. Successful and long-lived examples of Free Software projects 
that use Guile are TeXmacs, LilyPond, and GnuCash.
