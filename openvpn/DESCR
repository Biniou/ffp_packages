OpenVPN is a full-featured SSL VPN which implements OSI layer 2 or 3 secure 
network extension using the industry standard SSL/TLS protocol, supports 
flexible client authentication methods based on certificates, smart cards, 
and/or username/password credentials, and allows user or group-specific 
access control policies using firewall rules applied to the VPN virtual 
interface. OpenVPN is not a web application proxy and does not operate 
through a web browser.

OpenVPN 2.0 expands on the capabilities of OpenVPN 1.x by offering a 
scalable client/server mode, allowing multiple clients to connect to a 
single OpenVPN server process over a single TCP or UDP port.
