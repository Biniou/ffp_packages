GNUnet is a framework for secure peer-to-peer networking that does not 
use any centralized or otherwise trusted services. 

A first service implemented on top of the networking layer allows 
anonymous censorship-resistant file-sharing. 

Anonymity is provided by making messages originating from a peer 
indistinguishable from messages that the peer is routing. 

All peers act as routers and use link-encrypted connections with 
stable bandwidth utilization to communicate with each other. 

GNUnet uses a simple, excess-based economic model to allocate resources. 

Peers in GNUnet monitor each others behavior with respect to resource usage; 
peers that contribute to the network are rewarded with better service. 

GNUnet is part of the GNU project.
