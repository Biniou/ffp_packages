The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide 
support for Power Devices, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies, Power 
Distribution Units and Solar Controllers. 

NUT provides many control and monitoring features, with a uniform 
control and management interface. 

More than 100 different manufacturers, and several thousands models are 
compatible. 

This software is the combined effort of many individuals and companies.
