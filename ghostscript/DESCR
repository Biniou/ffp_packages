Ghostscript is a package of software that provides: 

An interpreter for the PostScript (TM) language, with the ability to 
convert PostScript language files to many raster formats, view them on 
displays, and print them on printers that don't have PostScript language 
capability built in; An interpreter for Portable Document Format (PDF) 
files, with the same abilities; The ability to convert PostScript 
language files to PDF (with some limitations) and vice versa; and A set 
of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the graphics 
and filtering (data compression / decompression / conversion) 
capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the PostScript 
language and in PDF. 

Ghostscript is written entirely in C, with special care taken to make it 
run properly on a wide variety of systems, including MS Windows, Apple 
MacOS, the wide variety of Unix and Unix-like platforms and VMS systems.
