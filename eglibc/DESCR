Embedded GLIBC (EGLIBC) is a variant of the GNU C Library (GLIBC) that 
is designed to work well on embedded systems. EGLIBC strives to be 
source and binary compatible with GLIBC. EGLIBC's goals include reduced 
footprint, configurable components, better support for cross-compilation 
and cross-testing.
