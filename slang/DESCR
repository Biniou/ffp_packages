S-Lang is a multi-platform programmer's library designed to allow a developer 
to create robust multi-platform software. 
It provides facilities required by interactive applications such as 
display/screen management, keyboard input, keymaps, and so on. 
The most exciting feature of the library is the slang interpreter that may 
be easily embedded into a program to make it extensible. 
While the emphasis has always been on the embedded nature of the interpreter, 
it may also be used in a stand-alone fashion through the use of slsh, 
which is part of the S-Lang distribution.

Unlike many interpreters, the S-Lang interpreter supports all of the native 
C integer types (signed and unsigned versions of char, short, int, long, 
and long long), and both single and double precision types, as well as a 
double precision complex type. 
Other data types supported by the interpreter include strings, lists, 
associative arrays (hashes), user-defined structures, and multi-dimensional 
arrays of any data-type.
