GNU libmicrohttpd is a small C library that is supposed to make it easy to 
run an HTTP server as part of another application. 

GNU libmicrohttpd is free software and part of the GNU project.

Key features that distinguish libmicrohttpd from other projects are:

    C library: fast and small
    API is simple, expressive and fully reentrant
    Implementation is HTTP 1.1 compliant
    HTTP server can listen on multiple ports
    Four different threading models (select, poll, pthread, thread pool)
    Supported platforms include GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OS X, 
	W32, Symbian and z/OS
    Support for IPv6
    Support for SHOUTcast
    Support for incremental processing of POST data (optional)
    Support for basic and digest authentication (optional)
    Support for SSL3 and TLS (requires libgcrypt and libgnutls, optional)
    Binary is only about 32k (without TLS/SSL support and other optional 
	features)

libmicrohttpd was started because the author needed an easy way to add a 
concurrent HTTP server to other projects. 

Existing alternatives were either non-free, not reentrant, standalone, 
of terrible code quality or a combination thereof. 

Do not use libmicrohttpd if you are looking for a standalone HTTP server, 
there are many other projects out there that provide that kind of 
functionality already. 

However, if you want to be able to serve simple WWW pages from within 
your C or C++ application, check it out.
