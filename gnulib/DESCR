Gnulib is a central location for common GNU code, intended to be shared 
among GNU packages. GCC has libiberty, but this is hard to disentangle 
from the GCC build tree.

Gnulib takes a different approach. Its components are intended to be 
shared at the source level, rather than being a library that gets built, 
installed, and linked against. Thus, there is no distribution tarball; 
the idea is to copy files from Gnulib into your own source tree.

Gnulib also includes copies of a few files purely for convenience: 
the GNU coding standards, the GNU maintainer information, the GPL and 
other licenses (in Texinfo), assorted configuration scripts, and more. 
The goal is to provide all the common infrastructure needed by GNU packages.
