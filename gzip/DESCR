GNU Gzip is a popular data compression program originally written by 
Jean-loup Gailly for the GNU project. 

Mark Adler wrote the decompression part. 

We developed this program as a replacement for compress because of the 
Unisys and IBM patents covering the LZW algorithm used by compress. 

These patents made it impossible for us to use compress, and we needed a 
replacement. The superior compression ratio of gzip is just a bonus.
