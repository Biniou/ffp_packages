Netfilter.org is home to the software of the packet filtering framework 
inside the Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernel series. Software commonly associated 
with netfilter.org is iptables.

Software inside this framework enables packet filtering, network address 
[and port] translation (NA[P]T) and other packet mangling. 
It is the re-designed and heavily improved successor of the previous 
Linux 2.2.x ipchains and Linux 2.0.x ipfwadm systems.

netfilter is a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel 
modules to register callback functions with the network stack. 
A registered callback function is then called back for every packet 
that traverses the respective hook within the network stack.

iptables is a generic table structure for the definition of rulesets. 
Each rule within an IP table consists of a number of classifiers 
(iptables matches) and one connected action (iptables target).

netfilter, ip_tables, connection tracking (ip_conntrack, nf_conntrack) 
and the NAT subsystem together build the major parts of the framework.
