GNU libextractor is a library used to extract meta data from files of 
arbitrary type. 

It is designed to use helper-libraries to perform the actual extraction, 
and to be trivially extendable by linking against external extractors for 
additional file types. libextractor is a GNU package. 

Our official GNU website can be found at 
http://www.gnu.org/software/libextractor/. 

libextractor can be downloaded from this site or the GNU mirrors.

The goal is to provide developers of file-sharing networks, browsers or 
WWW-indexing bots with a universal library to obtain simple keywords and 
meta data to match against queries and to show to users instead of only 
relying on filenames. 

libextractor contains a shell command extract that, similar to the 
well-known file command, can extract meta data from a file an print 
the results to stdout.

Currently, libextractor supports the following formats: 
HTML, PDF, PS, OLE2 (DOC, XLS, PPT), OpenOffice (sxw), StarOffice (sdw), 
DVI, MAN, FLAC, MP3 (ID3v1 and ID3v2), NSF(E) (NES music), SID (C64 music), 
OGG, WAV, EXIV2, JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, DEB, RPM, TAR(.GZ), ZIP, ELF, 
S3M (Scream Tracker 3), XM (eXtended Module), IT (Impulse Tracker), FLV, 
REAL, RIFF (AVI), MPEG, QT and ASF.

Also, various additional MIME types are detected.
