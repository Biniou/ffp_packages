 Munin is a networked resource monitoring tool that can help analyze resource trends and 
"what just happened to kill our performance?" problems. 
It is designed to be very plug and play. 
A default installation provides a lot of graphs with almost no work.

In Norse mythology Hugin and Munin are the ravens of the god king Odin. 
They flew all over Midgard for him, seeing and remembering, and later telling him.

"Munin" means "memory".
