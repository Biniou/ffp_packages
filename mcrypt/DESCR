 MCrypt is a replacement for the old crypt() package and crypt(1) 
command, with extensions. It allows developers to use a wide range of 
encryption functions, without making drastic changes to their code. It 
allows users to encrypt files or data streams without having to be 
cryptographers. Above all, it allows you to have some really neat code 
on your machine. :) 

The companion to MCrypt is Libmcrypt, which contains the actual 
encryption functions themselves, and provides a standardized mechanism 
for accessing them.
