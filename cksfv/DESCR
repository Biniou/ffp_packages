Check SFV (Simple File Verification)
Description
Some files that you download will come with a .sfv file. 

This is used to verify that the files that you received are the same 
as the originals. 

cksfv is a program that can use the .sfv file to verify the downloaded files. 

Also, it can be used to create new .sfv files.

IMPORTANT:
Originally this is Bryan Call's project. 

I decided to start maintain this project since I (Heikki Orsila) 
couldn't reach the developer with a 64-bit architecture fix. 

I'd be happy to let him maintain this useful tool, 
if he contacted me.
