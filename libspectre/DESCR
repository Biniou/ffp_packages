What is libspectre 

libspectre is a small library for rendering Postscript documents. It 
provides a convenient easy to use API for handling and rendering 
Postscript documents. 

libspectre it's known to work on UNIX/Linux systems although supporting 
other platforms (win32, macos) is planned too. Any help on this is, of 
course, more than welcome :-) 

libspectre is free software and is available to be redistributed and/or 
modified under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published 
by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option) 
any later version.
