Shell In A Box implements a web server that can export arbitrary command line 
tools to a web based terminal emulator. 

This emulator is accessible to any JavaScript and CSS enabled web browser 
and does not require any additional browser plugins. 

Most typically, login shells would be exported this way: 
shellinaboxd -s /:LOGIN

This command starts a web server at http://localhost:4200 that allows users 
to login with their username and password and to get access to their 
login shell.

All client-server communications are encrypted, if SSL/TLS certificates have 
been installed.
