Introduction to sysstat

The sysstat package contains utilities to monitor system performance and 
usage activity. Sysstat contains various utilities, common to many 
commercial Unixes, and tools you can schedule via cron to collect and 
historize performance and activity data.

    iostat(1) reports CPU statistics and input/output statistics for devices, 
partitions and network filesystems.
    mpstat(1) reports individual or combined processor related statistics.
    pidstat(1) reports statistics for Linux tasks (processes) : I/O, CPU, 
memory, etc.
    sar(1) collects, reports and saves system activity information (CPU, 
memory, disks, interrupts, network interfaces, TTY, kernel tables,etc.)
    sadc(8) is the system activity data collector, used as a backend for sar.
    sa1(8) collects and stores binary data in the system activity daily 
data file. It is a front end to sadc designed to be run from cron.
    sa2(8) writes a summarized daily activity report. It is a front end 
to sar designed to be run from cron.
    sadf(1) displays data collected by sar in multiple formats 
(CSV, XML, etc.) This is useful to load performance data into a database, 
or import them in a spreadsheet to make graphs.
    nfsiostat(1) reports input/output statistics for network filesystems (NFS).
    cifsiostat(1) reports CIFS statistics.
