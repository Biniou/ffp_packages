Nmap and Zenmap (the graphical front end) are available in 
several versions and formats. 

Recent source releases and binary packages are described below. 

Older version (and sometimes newer test releases) are 
available from the dist directory 
(and really old ones are in dist-old). 

For the more security-paranoid (smart) users, 
GPG detached signatures and SHA-1 hashes for each release 
are available in the sigs directory (verification instructions). 

Before downloading, be sure to read the relevant sections 
for your platform from the Nmap Install Guide. 

The most important changes (features, bugfixes, etc) in each 
Nmap version are described in the Changelog. 

Using Nmap is covered in the Reference Guide, and don't forget 
to read the other available documentation, particularly the 
new book Nmap Network Scanning!
