dtach - A program that emulates the detach feature of screen
dtach is a tiny program that emulates the detach feature of screen, 
allowing you to run a program in an environment that is protected from 
the controlling terminal and attach to it later. 
dtach does not keep track of the contents of the screen, and thus works 
best with programs that know how to redraw themselves.

dtach does not, however, have the other features of screen, such as its 
support of multiple terminals or its terminal emulation support. 
This makes dtach extremely tiny compared to screen, making it more easily 
audited for bugs and security holes, and also allows it to fit in 
environments where space is limited, such as on rescue disks.

dtach has many possible uses, even though it is tiny. With dtach, you can:

    Attach multiple times to the same program. 
Access to the dtach session is controlled through the Unix filesystem 
permissions; thus, you can trivially allow other people to watch your session.
    Run a program in an environment that is protected from 
the controlling terminal. This means that, for instance, the program 
running under dtach would not be affected by the terminal being 
disconnected for some reason.
    Run programs such as emacs, which tend to want full control over the 
terminal. 
dtach mostly acts as a relay, and does not mangle the text between the 
application and your terminal.
    Suspend dtach without suspending the running program. 
dtach can handle the suspend key itself instead of passing it to the 
running program, which may be useful for certain programs such as ircII.
