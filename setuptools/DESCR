Easy Install is a python module (easy_install) bundled with setuptools 
that lets you automatically download, build, install, and manage 
Python packages.

Please share your experiences with us! 
If you encounter difficulty installing a package, please contact us via 
the distutils mailing list. 
(Note: please DO NOT send private email directly to the author of 
setuptools; it will be discarded. 
The mailing list is a searchable archive of previously-asked and 
answered questions; 
you should begin your research there before reporting something as a bug 
-- and then do so via list discussion first.)

(Also, if you'd like to learn about how you can use setuptools to 
make your own packages work better with EasyInstall, 
or provide EasyInstall-like features without requiring your users to 
use EasyInstall directly, you'll probably want to check out the 
full setuptools documentation as well.)
